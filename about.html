      <h1>About National Movement </h1>

<p>The Indian National Movement was a prolonged and multifaceted collective actions of resistance against British colonialism, covering the period from the Revolt of 1857 to the independence in 1947. It was not a political campaign alone; it was a journey that transformed the social, cultural, and ideological scenery of the Indian subcontinent.</p>

<p>What began as polite petitions for constitutional reform soon grew into a passionate struggle for freedom. India's leaders worked together to make many different groups of people feel like they were all part of one country, as such creating the identity of Indian Nation. Their shared ideals and collective thoughts about right and wrong helped laid foundation for the principles of Indian Nation.</p>

<p>The project seeks to move beyond traditional historiography, which often presents history as a monolithic object a grand narrative and develop a model which narrate the contribution of the people involved in the national movement whose names have become a part of Delhi’s Urban morphology through commemoration of roads.</p>

<p>This involves systematically linking the core history curriculum with other domains, such as geography (via the interactive map), media (gallery development), historical literature (via archival access), and technology.</p>

    <p><strong>Historical Analysis </strong></p>
<p>Collection and literature review of secondary resources (books, archival documents, newspapers, photographs, government records)</p>

<p>The website is based on the Borg and Gall development model which consists of 10 steps, (1) research and information collecting, (2) planning, (3) developing preliminary forms of product, (4) preliminary field testing, (5) playing product revision, (6) playing field testing, (7) operational product revision, (8) operational field testing, (9) final product revision, and (10) dissemination and implementation (Lubis et. al,
2019).</p>
